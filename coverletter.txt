Dear Sir or Madam,

I am interested in a Software Developer position with Dematic. I heard about Dematic from a former classmate at Grand Vallye State Univeristy, and though it might be a great place to work.

I am a recent graduate at Grand Valley State University with a Bachelor degree in
Computer Science. Now I am looking for a position that I am passionate about software engineer work. Your company is very apt to the types of technologies
I am looking forward to working with in my career and the culture and mix of people
would be a great opportunity for me.

At CleanLogix I have done user interface design with Ruby and QT,and also helped
develop a website front-end with PHP and JQuery.  I helped program a backend protocal framework utilizing the CAN protocal for communicaiton between air powered pnuematic pump controllers for chemical dispensing. I  also have done formal school training with projects in c, c++, java, and web design, and my Senior Capstone Course
involved a Data Mining application with Django and a python flask backend, check
it out at avalanche.evavro.com. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss what positions you man have available for a recent college graduate.

Best Regards,
Matthew Levandowski
