Dear Sir or Madam,

I am interested in a Software Developer position with AthenaHealth. I found
the job on the joelonsoftware.com Job Board. I love to read his blog and he has
many insightful article on software development and the software culture.

I am a recent graduate at Grand Valley State University with a Bachelor degree in
Computer Science. Now I am looking for a position that I am passionate about web
and front end development. Your company is very apt to the types of technologies
I am looking forward to working with in my career and the culture and mix of people
would be a great opportunity for me.

At Spectrum Health I interned as an application analyst.  From there I went to a full time System Analsyst, but the software we used was outdated and I have a passion for developing new technologies. I am always looking to
learn more development frameworks and technologies.  I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss what positions you man have.

Best Regards,
Matthew Levandowski
