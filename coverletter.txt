Dear Sir or Madam:

	I am currently a Senior majoring in Computer Science and want to minor in Business as well. I have served 4 years in the United States Army as a 25F Network Switching Systems Operator and communication specialist, and I am currently in the Army Reserve for the following year until my contract time is up. My job experience so far has been focused on communication equipment and networking.  I believe my skills and education will pair up very well with your needs.  I am interested in either a developement or an information technology position upon graduation at GVSU.  
       I would appreciate the oppurtunity to discuss what positions you man have.  If you have any other questions or need more information from me I can provide those as well.  Thank you for your time.
