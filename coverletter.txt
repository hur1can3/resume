Dear Sir or Madam:

	I recently attended a Defense Logistics Agency Info Session at Grand Valley State University on the 21st.  I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science and want to minor in Information Systems as well. I have served 4 years in the United States Army as a 25F Network Switching Systems Operator and communication specialist, and I am currently in the Army Reserve for the following year until my contract time is up. My job experience so far has been focused on communication equipment and networking.  I believe my skills and education will pair up very well with your needs.  I am interested in either a developement or an information technology position upon graduation at GVSU.  
       I have trained on the old Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) network system and have limited training on the Joint Network Node (JNN) in my MOS.  I am enjoying learning new programming skills and am currently working on learning xml and sql for data storage solutions.  I am very familiar with linux or unix based operating systems such as debian, fedora, or solaris workstations.  I am also currently studying for CompTIA certification in A+ computer repair and linux certification and hope to achieve those this summer.
       I would appreciate the oppurtunity to discuss what positions you man have.  If you have any other questions or need more information from me such as a DD-214 or transcript I can provide those as well.  
Thank you for your time.

Sincerly,
